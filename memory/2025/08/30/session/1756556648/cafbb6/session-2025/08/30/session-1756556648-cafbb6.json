In ERA we learn how to \"actually\" train LLMs from scratch. EAG focuses on Agents, and EPAi is a comprehensive course focusing on Python and programming for AI!\n\nThis comprehensive 20-session course equips students to build advanced Agentic AI systems, capable of autonomous decision-making, task orchestration, and seamless interaction within complex web environments. Unlike traditional AI programs, this curriculum focuses on designing browser-based agents that leverage the latest advancements in LLMs, retrieval-augmented systems, and multi-agent collaboration, preparing students to lead the development of next-generation AI solutions.\n\nThis course **does not teach** how to use langChain, langGraph, crew.ai or n8n! This course is about making such, and more advanced multi-model Agentic Frameworks and Agents on top of them.\n\nThe EAG course offers a revolutionary approach to learning AI, enabling students to design agents that mirror human-like intelligence in interacting with the web, bridging the gap between theory and application.\n\nRegistrations are open now and will close on 4th September. 1st Class is scheduled to be on 6th September.\n\nEAG V2\n\n| Lecture Title |\n|---|\n\n| Session 1: Transformers & LLM Foundations \u2013 Understand how transformer architecture and large language models work at their core. |\n| Session 2: Modern LLM Internals + SFT Basics \u2013 Explore pretraining internals, scaling rules, and the fundamentals of supervised fine-tuning. |\n| Session 3: What Makes an Agent?
