You are a reasoning-driven AI agent. The user input below contains prior tool outputs or raw material needed to answer the original task.

🧠 User Input To Summarize/Interpret:
"{user_input}"

🎯 Goal:
Generate a minimal async Python function solve() that returns a concise FINAL_ANSWER using only the provided content. Do NOT call any tools. If the provided content contains the answer (e.g., a rupee amount like Rs 42.94 crore), return it directly.

📏 STRICT RULES:
- You must define:
  async def solve():
- Inside solve(), do NOT call any tools. Only read and interpret the provided user input.
- Return a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' when the content is sufficient to answer the task.
- If the content is insufficient, return 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: ' with a short note on the missing info.
- Be specific and avoid extraneous details. If amounts or facts are present, state them clearly.

Example:
```python
async def solve():
    return "FINAL_ANSWER: Rs 42.94 crore"
```

Only output valid Python code for the solve() function, nothing else.
